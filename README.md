# Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Dim your Hue bulbs smoothly in "press to dim, release to stop" automations.

This integration eliminates the visual stuttering in HA "stepped" dimming loops, by using Hue's native API dimming methods.

## Key Benefits 🔅💡🔆

* **Silky Smooth:** No more jumpy brightness changes or overshoots in "press to dim" automations. Brightness transitions are continuous, predictable and polished, mirroring the behavior of a high-quality physical dimmer.
* **Instant setup:** The integration works with the lights you've already added to the core HA Hue integration. 
* **Network Friendly:** With less chatter between HA and your lights, your home network and Hue mesh remain responsive and clear.

## Requirements:
* **[Philips Hue integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)** installed and configured.
* **Hardware:** Philips Hue Bridge V2.

> [!NOTE]
> The original Bridge V1 is unsupported as it uses different API methods and I didn't have a V1 to test.

## Example Usage

To dim your Hue lights smoothly with a two-button remote:

```yaml
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_left
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.lower
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.raise
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - release_left
              - release_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.stop
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
```

> [!TIP]
> To control multiple lights, target a **Hue Group** rather than multiple individual lights. This allows the Hue Bridge to send a single Zigbee broadcast, which dims all the lights together perfectly.
