# Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer

[![HACS Default](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://hacs.xyz/) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jasonmx/philips-hue-smooth-dimmer)

Dim your Hue bulbs smoothly in "press to dim, release to stop" automations.

This integration eliminates the visual stuttering in HA "stepped" dimming loops, by implementing the Hue V2 API's dimming methods.

## Key Benefits 🔅💡🔆

* **Silky Smooth:** No more jumpy brightness changes or overshoots in "press to dim" automations. Dimming is continuous and precise, mirroring a high-quality physical dimmer.
* **Instant Setup:** Communicates with your Hue bridges and lights via the core Philips Hue integration. 
* **Network Friendly:** With less chatter between HA and your lights, your home network and Hue mesh remain responsive and clear.

---

## Requirements:
* **[Philips Hue integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)** installed and configured.
* **Hardware:** Philips Hue Bridge V2 or Pro (V3).

> [!NOTE]
> Bridge V1 is unsupported, as the V1 API uses different methods.

## Example Usage

To dim your Hue lights smoothly with a two-button remote:

```yaml
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_left
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.lower
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.raise
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - release_left
              - release_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.stop
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
```

> [!TIP]
> To control multiple lights, target a **Hue Group** rather than multiple individual lights. This allows the Hue Bridge to send a single Zigbee broadcast, which dims all the lights together perfectly.
