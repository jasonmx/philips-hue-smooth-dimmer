# Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Dim your Hue bulbs smoothly in automations.

This integration eliminates the visual stuttering and network congestion caused by traditional "stepped" dimming loops, by leveraging the Philips Hue V2 API's native dimming commands.

## Key Benefits 🔅💡🔆

* **Silky Smooth:** No more jumpy brightness changes or overshoots in "press to dim, release to stop" automations. Brightness transitions are predictable, continuous and visually polished, mirroring the behavior of a high-quality physical dimmer.
* **Instant setup:** The integration works the lights you've already set up in the core Hue integration. 
* **Network Friendly:** By sending only two Hue API commands instead of lots of small brightness steps, your home LAN and Hue meshes remain responsive and clear.

## Requirements:
* **Hardware:** Philips Hue Bridge V2. Legacy V1 bridges are not supported.
* **[Philips Hue integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)** installed.

## Example Usage

To dim your Hue lights smoothly with a two-button remote:

```yaml
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_left
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.lower
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.raise
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - release_left
              - release_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.stop
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
```

> [!TIP]
> To control multiple lights, target a **Hue Group** rather than multiple individual lights. This allows the Hue Bridge to send a single Zigbee broadcast, which dims all the lights together perfectly.
