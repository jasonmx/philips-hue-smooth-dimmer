# Hue Smooth Dimming

Hue Smooth Dimming adds **silky smooth transitions** to the official Philips Hue integration on v2 Bridges, by leveraging Hue bulbs' native transition capabilities instead of relying on repeated incremental brightness change instructions from HA.

The result is the same premium, high-end feel that you get using Philips Hue's own dimmers, without visual stuttering, lags or overshoots.

## Key Benefits

* **Silky Smooth UX:** No more stuttering lights, overshoots and low family approval ratings. Transitions are fluid, continuous, and visually polished.
* **Intuitive Constant Speed:** Lights move at a predictable, natural pace that mirrors the behavior of a high-quality physical dimmer. E.g. with a 5s Sweep Time, the brightness changes at 20% per second.
* **Less Network Load:** By sending only two commands (Start and Stop) instead of dozens of brightness changes, your Zigbee mesh remains responsive and clear.
* **Simple setup:** This helper extends the capabilities of your existing Hue lights and groups via the core Hue integration. No secondary login is required.
