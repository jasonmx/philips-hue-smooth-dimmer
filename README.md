# Philips Hue Smooth Dimmer

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Dim your Hue bulbs smoothly in automations.

This integration eliminates the visual stuttering and network congestion caused by traditional "stepped" dimming loops, by using the Philips Hue V2 API's native dimming commands.

## Key Benefits 🔅💡🔆

* **Silky Smooth:** No more jumpy brightness changes or overshoots in "press to dim, release to stop" automations. Brightness transitions are predictable, continuous and visually polished, mirroring the behavior of a high-quality physical dimmer.
* **Network Friendly:** By sending only two Hue API commands instead of lots of small brightness steps, your home LAN and Hue meshes remain responsive and clear.
* **Zero setup:** This helper works instantly with Hue lights already added via the core Hue integration.

## Requirements:
* **Hardware:** Philips Hue Bridge V2. Legacy V1 bridges are not supported.
* **[Philips Hue core integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)**.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `target` | (Required) | The Hue light(s) or group(s) to control. |
| `sweep_time` | `5` | Seconds for a full 0-100% transition. |
| `limit` | `100` | Stop transition at this brightness (default 100%). |

### `hue_dimmer.lower`
Starts decreasing the brightness, and turns off at 0%.

| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `target` | (Required) | The Hue light(s) or group(s) to control. |
| `sweep_time` | `5` | Seconds for a full 100-0% transition. |
| `limit` | `0` | Stop transition at this brightness (default 0%). Use at least 0.2% to keep a light turned on. |

> [!TIP]
> Hue's minimum supported brightness is 0.2% for regular bulbs and 2.0% for Essential bulbs. Source: [Hueblog post](https://hueblog.com/2025/09/18/new-hue-bulbs-cannot-be-dimmed-any-lower/).

## Example Usage

To dim your Hue lights smoothly with a two-button remote:

```yaml
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_left
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.lower
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - long_press_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.raise
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
      - conditions:
          - condition: trigger
            id:
              - release_left
              - release_right
        sequence:
          - action: hue_dimmer.stop
            target:
              entity_id: light.living_room
```

> [!TIP]
> To synchronize dimming perfectly across multiple lights, target **Hue Groups** rather than HA groups or individual lights. This allows the Hue Bridge to send a single Zigbee broadcast, ensuring all the lights start and stop together.
